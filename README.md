<summary><h2>Step 1: Data source </h2></summary>
The original data includes 250 million news articles from over 27 U.S. publications, so we ranked publishers based on the number of articles and selected the top six publishers: Reuters, The New York Times, CNBC, The Hill, People, and CNNA database of 11,852 articles was created by randomly selecting 2,000 articles from each publisher, after removing empty articles. The data size was 40.9 MB. The filtered dataset was created with six features: Type, Id, NewsSource, Year, Title, and Article. Figure 9 is a screen shot of the csv data used in the project. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113126104/189190801-5eda2e31-d0cf-495d-808d-1b8af0a9ba67.png)
